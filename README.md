# Smartsheet Clone

## Summary
Gift registry automation using the Smartsheet API.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always DM me on the twitter @rbocchinfuso._

#### The Idea
Exhausted by spreadsheets, email and humans doing highly repetitive and easily automated work for which the computer was invented.

#### Looking Ahead
The approach I taken with this project which I hacked in 2016 while at OSCON will become the basis for other sentiment analysis projects.  For example, mining ServiceNow Incident and Request notes via the SNOW API and determine sentiment by incident/request, agent, company, engagement channel (phone, email, service portal), CI, etc...  Of course these projects will be written in Python.
